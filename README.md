## Game Description

Scourge of the Seven Seas is a pirate themed incremental game. Users are able to create an account consisting of a username, email, and password. Upon reaching the main game page, users can click on the pirate gif displayed to increase their score. There are three pirate gifs available, and users can switch between them as they please. Number of clicks are recorded, and once users reach certain point values, they are able to "buy" certain upgrades. These upgrades include increases in active points per click, as well as passive points. Users can click on the "profile" button to view their account information, update their account information, and delete their account. Users must click the "save" button to save game progress before exiting the application. If a user wishes to log out, they must save their progress, and then click the "log out" button to return to the login page.  

## Login / Sign Up

If a user is new to the game, they must fill out the sign up form. Upon account creation, they must then fill out the login form with this information to reach the main game page. Returning users can just input their username and password into the login form to reach the main game page.
